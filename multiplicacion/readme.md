# Ancient Multiplication Efficiency

This program compares the efficiency of different multiplication methods, including the ancient Russian Peasant method, across C and Assembly implementations.

## Description

The program generates 8 random numbers (0-999) to create a 4x4 table, resulting in 16 unique multiplications. It then calculates the execution time for these multiplications using three different methods in both C and Assembly:

1. Null Method: Returns 0 (control)
2. Standard Method: Regular multiplication (a * b)
3. Russian Peasant Method: An ancient multiplication algorithm

The program performs each multiplication N times to ensure accurate timing and also inverts the operands (B x A instead of A x B) for comprehensive analysis.

## Features
